# TinyTicketSystem
A simple ticket system for organizing small projects of a single developer like myself.

## Getting Started
- Just tell the application where to store the tickets using *File -> Set Ticket Directory*
- Create new tickets using **CTRL + N** or *File -> New Ticket*
- Double-Click on a Ticket to open the Editor

## Storage
Tickets are stored as markdown files named after their identifier. This enables viewing and editing them even without TinyTicketSystem running, by using tools like **VS Code**  
The ticket directory will contain:
- one index.md listing all tickets managed by the system
- folders named 100, 200, 300... containing all ticket files up to that number for easier browsing
